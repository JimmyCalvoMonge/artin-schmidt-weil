### Artin-Schmidt's Zeta Function
:green_apple:

A revision and implementation of Artin's Zeta Function for polynomials over finite fields. Joint work with Adrián Barquero-Sánchez.

- Algebraic Number Theory, Field Theory.
- `notes/` contains research notes with a revision of the work done by E. Artin and F.K. Schmidt.
- `references/` contains the original Artin's Thesis (1924) and F.K. Schmidt's article (1931) [In German].
- Implementation of Artin Zeta Function for polynomials of the form `y^2 = f(x)` is in a Jupyter Notebook. This is meant to be executed using `SageMath`, a python-based open source mathematical software.
